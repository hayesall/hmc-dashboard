commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.
Full CoreUI Icons Free license: https://coreui.io/icons/license/.

Icons: CC BY 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
In the CoreUI Icons Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons
packaged as SVG and JS file types.

Fonts: SIL OFL 1.1 License (https://scripts.sil.org/OFL)
In the CoreUI Icons Free download, the SIL OLF license applies to all icons
packaged as web and desktop font files.

Code: MIT License (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
In the CoreUI Icons Free download, the MIT license applies to all non-font and
non-icon files.

Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OLF, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded
CoreUI Icons Free files already contain embedded comments with sufficient
attribution, so you shouldn't need to do anything additional when using

We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to
learn about CoreUI Icons.
